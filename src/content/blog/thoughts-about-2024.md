This was a crazy year for me, and I need to inform you that my first
draft of this post was in the last days of November because I couldn't
wait to express my thoughts about my year in some words, so let's go.

I don't even know where to start this, but a topic that was the main goal
of my year was trying to be the best engineer that I could, and I really
think that I failed so many times when I was writing code, interacting
with people, and doing other things in my work that I cannot consider
that I gave the best version of me during this year, but one thing that I
can ensure is that I learned a LOT when I mean a lot is really a lot.

In the first months of this year, I just knew the basics of a backend,
things that you could learn in a YouTube tutorial, but when I started in
my current company, I was in charge of creating a backend that handles
thousands of requests per second when the same time I need to refactor
the legacy frontend and backend, was thought in the early days ( the days
that I learned most), but after 3-4 months I get the rhythm and could
delivery a lot of things. Besides the value that I add to the company and
the code, it brings me joy that one or two times per month I go back to a
function / page / module and I can refactor it to improve code quality
and throughput.

Outside my job, I learned go, lua, a little bit of elixir, a lot of
things about distributed systems, and some frontend stuff. But one thing that sticks with me during some months was improving my typing speed, I used computers since I was 5 or 6 years old but I never thought about how I used my keyboard, I just typed in random ways to write the words I wanted to write, but a friend recommended me to improve this because this could make a difference in my day-a-day, I was skeptical in the first time, but this [amazing article](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/09/01/typing-can-be-the-bottleneck/) from Thorsten Ball gave me the last push I need to improve my typing, and oh my god, in the start of October I had 45 wpm on average and now I had approximately 85-90 wpm, this bumps gave me soo much joy and now I really have a pleasant experience writing articles.

If I look back to the goals that I planned for this year, I didn't complete a lot of them, but I tried to do a lot of things that I didn't list, so I think that this is a clear sign that I need to improve how I list my goals!

A couple of things that I did in this year that make me proud to share is:

[golang compiler](https://github.com/YuriSamp/little-compiler) I really love everything from Thorsten Ball.

[cli-to-create-a-preset-project](https://github.com/YuriSamp/haji) This one I didn't use a lot of time but I could help one friend so this is enough for me.

[Yomu](https://github.com/YuriSamp/Yomu) A pet project trying to recreate the [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) tool.

[redis-cli-in-golang](https://github.com/YuriSamp/cli-database) I haven't finished this one yet but I pretend to go back sometime because this has a lot of cool features that I can do and learn from them.
