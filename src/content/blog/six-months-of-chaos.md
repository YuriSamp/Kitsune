December last year I bought my first domain and happily started blogging my thoughts, what I was studying at the time, in the first month I wrote 2 blog posts but things started falling apart when New Years Eve came so I could not keep my writing habit. Happily I decided to come back and write more so, to start with the right foot I am going to share what happened in the last six months of my life.

## January

The last article that I was writing was about DDD, I started writing in the last days of December and sadly I could not finish it, because the situation in my previous job was not so good and I really needed to search for a new job to keep improving as a software engineer, in parallel I was dealing with depression alone, altogether it drained all of my free time to pursue my hobbies so I ended up not writing anymore.

But not only bad things happened in January, in the second week I met Beatriz who later became my girlfriend and I started therapy to deal with my depression. Moreover the search for a new job yielded good results, I found a job that had an interesting problem to solve and I foresaw that I could grew in my career if I could handle the problem, however, as expected, again, I did not have time to write on my blog.

## February

The month started with one of my friends telling me about a freelance job that could give me twenty thousand bucks in couple months, and I thought that this opportunity plus my 9-5 job could be a good opportunity to improve some of my software engineering skills. however, what I did not think when I accepted this job was that my mental health was really fucked up.

So, the first two weeks of February were really good, I was learning about the business of my current job and coding the freelance after the working hours, but soon as I faced a big problem in the freelance that I could not solve alone (there was miscommunication about the deadline of the project) , everything fell apart, in one week I went from a happy guy to just crying in bed because I did not have enough strength to do anything.

## March

As expected, as soon as possible I left the freelance and focused all my free time doing fun things with my friends and reading a lot so as to improve my health again, I was not in the mood to do anything related to programming because I could not focus and I needed to slow down a little bit so as not to lose my job.

Thanks to that I had amazing experiences, I travelled on a plane for the first time in my life, I went to new places and ate a lot of different foods, I created amazing memories with my girlfriend and I'm glad that I created deep bounds with someone, I was not a good engineer in the first three months of the year, but I was evolving to become a better person and I think that is a pretty good tradeoff in the long term.

## April

This month was a big deal for me, for the first time in my life I would go live by myself, and the house that I rented was in another STATE, the process of renting a house from other state and dealing with all the logistics to move all of the furniture was a pain in the ass, I could not think of anything besides that, but the worst was yet to come.

When we arrived at our new home, we found out that we did not have any electricity ( soon we were informed that everything was right with the place), and because of that we could not live in the place that we rent for the next two weeks ( the deadline that was given to us by the energy company which is like the worst energy company to ever exist, aka, ENEL).

I already spent a lot of money moving furniture and solving a couple of problems in the house, so not a lot of money was left but even so we rented an Airbnb to live in this next week. It was a nightmare because the house was so small that I could not work sitting in a chair, I don't have a laptop so I could not work from bed, I needed to work standing up for 8 hours straight, looking down to a screen, for some reason life was good with me and we only spent 1 week without light in our home, so we left the Airbnb early.

## Now..

And here I am, finally I am in peace, last month experienced amazing things in São Paulo, I ate duck meat, Korean barbeque, I tried banana soda, Arabic food, a lot of different foods from Japan, and went to many beautiful places. Life has been great with me in the last 2 months and I could spend many paragraphs detailing every experience that I had, but I will keep this short and only say that right now I am back to studying computer science and writing a lot of my thoughts.

It was a mess in the first six months of the year however nothing lasts forever and I am looking forward to studying a lot and documenting everything in this blog again, if you are having a bad time, remember that someday things will be better again, even if it takes time. :)
